# DW Type System

(A Story of Structural Type System) 

# Type System

Set of rules that assigns a property called a `type` to the various constructs of a computer program, such as variables or functions.

# Type Systems

- Nominal Type Systems (i.e Java)
  - The name defines the type  
- Structural Type System 
  - The Shape defines the type
  
# DW Use

- Design time: 
    - Validate that all the rules are being satisfied to avoid Runtime Errors.
    - Autocompletion suggest the rights set of functions
- Runtime: Discriminates values based on the rules of the type system.
